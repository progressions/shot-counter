    "A magical storm caused by the war in the nether slipped out of a portal and obliterated her hometown of Sawdale. While visiting the ruins in the hopes of finding any belongings from what was her home, she ended up following her father's ghost to the portal. Minutes after stepping through, it snapped shut as the Chi Machine went off in the future, shifting the junctures. She now hopes to fix the juncture portals to get home... if she still has one... And along the way, hopes to put an end to the chi war, or at least stop the open hostilities that are causing innocent bystanders to suffer. Kinda wants to find the Ascended in charge of the drug runners, too."},
