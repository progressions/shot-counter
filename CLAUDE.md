# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

### Testing

**IMPORTANT: RVM/Ruby Environment Setup**
This project uses RVM with Ruby 3.2.2. To run specs successfully, you MUST use this exact command format:

```bash
source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm && rvm use 3.2.2 && bundle exec rspec [spec_path]
```

**Working Commands:**
- `source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm && rvm use 3.2.2 && bundle exec rspec` - Run the full test suite
- `source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm && rvm use 3.2.2 && bundle exec rspec spec/models/` - Run model tests only
- `source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm && rvm use 3.2.2 && bundle exec rspec spec/controllers/` - Run controller tests only
- `source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm && rvm use 3.2.2 && bundle exec rspec spec/path/to/specific_spec.rb` - Run a specific test file

**Note:** Just running `bundle exec rspec` without the RVM setup will fail with LoadError: cannot load such file -- rubygems/uri

**Ruby Version:** 3.2.2 (specified in .ruby-version file)

### Database
- `rails db:migrate` - Run pending migrations
- `rails db:seed` - Seed the database with initial data
- `rails db:reset` - Drop, create, migrate and seed the database
- `rails db:rollback` - Rollback the last migration

### Development Server
- `rails server` or `rails s` - Start the development server (default port 3000)
- `bundle exec sidekiq` - Start background job processing

### Discord Bot Commands
- `rails discord:register_commands` - Register Discord slash commands with the Discord API

### Rails Console and Debugging
- `rails console` or `rails c` - Start Rails console for debugging and data exploration
- `rails routes` - View all available routes

### API Testing with curl

**Authentication:**
The API uses Devise JWT authentication. To test API endpoints with curl, you need to obtain a JWT token first.

**Step 1: Get JWT Token**
```bash
# Login to get JWT token (replace with actual user credentials)
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/users/sign_in \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user":{"email":"progressions@gmail.com","password":"password"}}' \
  -i | grep -i authorization | cut -d' ' -f2
```

**Step 2: Use Token for API Calls**
```bash
# Set token variable
TOKEN="your-jwt-token-here"

# Create an invitation
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v2/invitations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"invitation":{"email":"newuser@example.com"}}'

# List invitations
curl -s -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/v2/invitations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"

# Get specific invitation (public endpoint, no auth needed)
curl -s -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/v2/invitations/INVITATION_ID
```

**Common Test Data:**
- **Gamemaster**: `progressions@gmail.com` (password: `password`)
- **Player**: `player@example.com` (password: `password`)

**Testing Invitation System:**
```bash
# Complete flow to create and test invitation
# 1. Get auth token (extract just the token part)
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/users/sign_in \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user":{"email":"progressions@gmail.com","password":"password"}}' \
  -i | grep -i '^authorization:' | cut -d' ' -f2-)

# 2. Create invitation
INVITATION=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v2/invitations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"invitation":{"email":"test@example.com"}}')

# 3. Extract invitation ID and create test URL
INVITATION_ID=$(echo $INVITATION | jq -r '.id')
echo "Test URL: http://localhost:3001/redeem/$INVITATION_ID"
```

**One-Liner for Quick Testing:**
```bash
# Single command to create invitation and get URL
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/users/sign_in -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"user":{"email":"progressions@gmail.com","password":"password"}}' -i | grep -i '^authorization:' | cut -d' ' -f2-) && INVITATION=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v2/invitations -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: $TOKEN" -d '{"invitation":{"email":"newuser@example.com"}}') && INVITATION_ID=$(echo $INVITATION | jq -r '.id') && echo "ðŸŽ¯ Invitation URL: http://localhost:3001/redeem/$INVITATION_ID"
```

**Working Example (Manual Token):**
```bash
# If the above fails, you can manually copy the token from a login response:
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v2/invitations \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -d '{"invitation":{"email":"newuser@example.com"}}'
```

**Note:** If authentication endpoints return 404, check the routes with `rails routes | grep auth` to verify the correct endpoint paths.

## Architecture Overview

This is a Ruby on Rails 8.0 API-only application serving as the backend for Chi War, a character and campaign manager for the Feng Shui 2 tabletop RPG. The app uses PostgreSQL as the primary database and Redis for caching and background jobs.

### Key Technologies
- **Rails 8.0** - Web framework
- **PostgreSQL** - Primary database
- **Redis** - Caching and job queue
- **Sidekiq** - Background job processing
- **Devise + JWT** - Authentication
- **Active Model Serializers** - JSON serialization
- **Discordrb** - Discord bot integration
- **Notion API** - External integration for character syncing

### API Structure
The application exposes two main API versions:
- `/api/v1/` - Legacy API with comprehensive endpoints
- `/api/v2/` - Newer API with simplified structure

Both APIs are RESTful and return JSON responses.

### Core Domain Models

**Campaigns** - Top-level containers for games. Users can be gamemasters (full access) or players (limited access).

**Characters** - Central to the game system. Multiple types:
- Player Characters (PCs)
- Non-Player Characters (NPCs) 
- Bosses, Featured Foes, Mooks, Allies (different antagonist/ally types)
- Each type has different relevant statistics and capabilities

**Fights** - Combat encounters that track initiative and actions using a "shot counter" system unique to Feng Shui 2.

**Shots** - The initiative/action tracking system. Characters act on numbered "shots" counting down from ~20 to 0.

**Vehicles** - Similar to characters but for vehicle chase scenes. Have their own stats and can participate in fights.

**Schticks** - Character abilities/talents with prerequisite relationships.

**Weapons** - Equipment that characters can carry and use in fights.

**Junctures** - Time periods in the Feng Shui 2 universe.

**Sites, Parties, Factions** - Campaign organization and world-building elements.

### Authentication & Authorization
- Uses Devise with JWT tokens for API authentication
- Users have roles: admin, gamemaster, player
- Campaign-based authorization - users can only access data from campaigns they're members of
- Current campaign context stored in Redis and set via `CurrentCampaign` service

### Background Jobs
Sidekiq handles background processing for:
- AI character creation and updates
- Discord notifications
- Notion API synchronization
- Image processing

### Discord Bot Integration
The app serves as a backend for Discord bot commands that allow:
- Starting and managing fights
- Displaying character and fight status
- Rolling dice
- Basic campaign management

### File Storage & Images
- Uses Active Storage with S3 backend (AWS)
- ImageKit integration for image processing and CDN
- PDF generation for character sheets

### Performance Considerations
- Database indexes optimized for common queries (see recent migrations)
- Uses bullet gem in development to detect N+1 queries
- Pagination implemented with Kaminari
- Redis caching for frequently accessed data

### Development Notes
- RSpec for testing with focus on models and controllers
- Pry for debugging in development
- Letter opener for email testing in development
- The codebase follows Rails conventions and uses Active Model Serializers for consistent JSON output
