# How the Dice Work
- **Swerve**: Roll a plus die and a minus die. Subtract the minus from the plus.
- **Action Result**: Add your Action Value (AV) to your Swerve.
- **Outcome**: If your Action Result meets or beats the target’s Defense, you hit! Subtract the target’s Defense from the Action Result.
- **Smackdown**: Add your Outcome to your weapon’s damage. Wounds: Subtract the target’s Toughness from the Smackdown Target takes that many Wound Points.
- **EXPLODING SIXES**: If you roll a six on one of your dice, roll it again and add the results. Keep rolling and adding til you roll something besides a six.
- **BOXCARS**: If you roll sixes on both dice, something remarkable happens! Reroll both dice and narrate an extreme version of the result.
- **FORTUNE**: Spend a Fortune point to add a single plus die to your Swerve. You can never add more than one Fortune point on a single roll. Fortune dice never explode.
