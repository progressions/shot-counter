Its finger-molded grip and rifle-like barrel grant it a formidable and exotic appearance. The gun fires a single shot, making it a deal-breaker for most. But with the right Reload schticks, reality can be explosively defied.  Its design leads many jurisdictions to class it as a short shotgun, and thus highly illegal.  Notably wielded by Mad Dog in Hard Boiled. Always reloads in slow motion, hence the 7 at the end of its game stats.

Packing a small rifle-round punch into a relatively compact frame, it appeals to shooters needing portability, from vehicle patrollers to counter-insurgents. Your gun expert character, while someone is shooting it at him, might want to explain that this is not strictly speaking a submachine gun, but rather belongs to the blandly explanatory category of “personal defense weapon.”

          description: A plasticky bullpup (short-stocked) assault rifle covered in futuristic ridges and macho filigrees, this gun looks like a reincarnated Adidas shoe with murder on its mind. Despite its visual distinctiveness, it has yet to make its mark on the movies, where so far it has been used chiefly for zombie abatement.

          name: Winchester Model 70 12/5/5
          description: Sure, you could carry a more modern rifle than the classic sports shooter’s bolt action, but you have your reasons. For one thing, this looks less militarized than today’s top hardware. That might still matter to you if you’re a Maverick Cop. Or maybe you want to be able to pass yourself off as a hunter or hobbyist. Mostly though, it’s Dirty Harry’s rifle, that’s why. You’ve even chambered it for his favored .458 Magnum.
