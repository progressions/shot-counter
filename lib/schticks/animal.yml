 Mini-Archetypes
Schticks for animal forms other than the dragon and crab appear in this book because the Transformed Dragon can use them.
Full-fledged archetypes for other animal types may follow later. Note: we accept bribes.
In the meantime, use the statistics in the accompanying table to cobble together quick ‘n dirty transformed animal mini-archetypes. Each starts play with 5 schticks, which can be drawn from:
• omni transformed animal schticks, above (maximum 4).
• their animal type schticks, below (maximum 5, minimum 2).
• gun schticks (maximum 1).
• fu schticks from the paths Healer, Outlaw, Montage, Nunchaku, Weapon Master, Wing Chun, Wushu (maximum 1).
Each gets the primary skill listed in the chart at 13, the specified Info skill at 13, and a skill of the player’s choice at 12.
Player decides whether the hero’s primary attack is Guns or Martial Arts. (Most schticks augment Martial Arts, making that the best bet.) The character gets the other of those attacks as a backup attack, with an AV one less than the main attack.
Start play with any two weapons.
Be aware that you’re taking a character that hasn’t been tested and fine-tuned to make it as much fun to play as the core archetypes. You might need to bring extra descriptive bravura to the table to compensate for a lack of mechanical flair.
