But their presence and appearance may provide clues to past events in the area. Densely populated areas always crawl with ghosts. No refunds on Magic points, even if you see no ghosts or none of them can help you.  Ordinary supporting characters sometimes develop this sense spontaneously, without knowing the first thing about sorcery. They may be victims of curses or physical trauma. Some received tissue transplants from dead donors who have become restless ghosts. They react to their new sense with understandable terror, and can’t choose when they see ghosts."

          name: Prediction
          description: "Spend 1 Magic to gain good, if somewhat obscure, advice or information about the future.  Most traditional Chinese mages employ the I Ching (pronounced yee jing), the ancient Book of Changes. You perform the divination by using an apparently random method to select one of its 64 cryptic verses, or hexagrams. The traditional method of invoking randomness has the user dividing yarrow stalks into odd and even clusters, arriving at a pair of trigrams. Trigrams are parallel broken or unbroken lines arranged in threes. Add the two trigrams together and you’ve got your hexagram. Example hexagrams include “Coupling,” “Diminishing,” or “The Well.” The real art comes in connecting the enigmatic verse and its other symbolic associations to the question you’re posing.  Even more traditional mages tell fortunes by throwing tortoise shells into the fire and then interpreting the patterns of cracks that appear on them after they are burned.  The GM provides a cryptic answer to a question posed by the sorcerer. This answer makes the player work to puzzle out its meaning and moves the plot along by providing a clue that gets the characters to the next scene.  If the GM is familiar with I Ching she can choose in advance an applicable hexagram.  If the attempt fails, the sorcerer gets a random hexagram instead. (The I Ching being what it is, the players may well find just as good advice in the random hexagram!)"

Spend 1 Magic to see the ghosts all around you in a single scene. Unless you count the odd grotesque transformation or ineffective lunge in your direction, they can’t really communicate with you. But their presence and appearance may provide clues to past events in the area. Densely populated areas always crawl with ghosts. No refunds on Magic points, even if you see no ghosts or none of them can help you.  Ordinary supporting characters sometimes develop this sense spontaneously, without knowing the first thing about sorcery. They may be victims of curses or physical trauma. Some received tissue transplants from dead donors who have become restless ghosts. They react to their new sense with understandable terror, and can’t choose when they see ghosts."

          name: prediction
          description: "Spend 1 Magic to gain good, if somewhat obscure, advice or information about the future.  Most traditional Chinese mages employ the I Ching (pronounced yee jing), the ancient Book of Changes. You perform the divination by using an apparently random method to select one of its 64 cryptic verses, or hexagrams. The traditional method of invoking randomness has the user dividing yarrow stalks into odd and even clusters, arriving at a pair of trigrams. Trigrams are parallel broken or unbroken lines arranged in threes. Add the two trigrams together and you’ve got your hexagram. Example hexagrams include “Coupling,” “Diminishing,” or “The Well.” The real art comes in connecting the enigmatic verse and its other symbolic associations to the question you’re posing.  Even more traditional mages tell fortunes by throwing tortoise shells into the fire and then interpreting the patterns of cracks that appear on them after they are burned.  The GM provides a cryptic answer to a question posed by the sorcerer. This answer makes the player work to puzzle out its meaning and moves the plot along by providing a clue that gets the characters to the next scene.  If the GM is familiar with I Ching she can choose in advance an applicable hexagram.  If the attempt fails, the sorcerer gets a random hexagram instead. (The I Ching being what it is, the players may well find just as good advice in the random hexagram!)"

          name: Invocation
          description: Spend 2 Magic to seize a particular creature through time and space and cause it to appear at your side. You can target a creature if you successfully used Domination against it in the past, or if you have on your person a former body part of the creature, such as a claw, piece of hair, scraping of skin, or severed hand. Requires a Sorcery Check against the creature’s Will Resistance value; on a failure, nothing happens and you get the Magic points back. Merely summoning a creature does not ensure its cooperation. In fact, in most cases guarantees your subject’s extreme displeasure.  You can invoke hero ghosts or supernatural creatures, but only if their players want it to happen. If they do, your attempt automatically succeeds and costs you nothing.  Spend 1 Magic or 3 shots to free a single individual of any effects caused by Sorcery or Creature Powers.
