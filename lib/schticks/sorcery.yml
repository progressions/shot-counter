          description: "Ghosts capable of acting on the physical world, like the ones represented by the Ghost archetype, are rare. Ordinary ghosts, trapped in spirit form between this world and the next, mindlessly repeating moments from their living days, swarm through every place where people have lived and died.  Spend 1 Magic to see the ghosts all around you in a single scene. Unless you count the odd grotesque transformation or ineffective lunge in your direction, they can’t really communicate with you. But their presence and appearance may provide clues to past events in the area. Densely populated areas always crawl with ghosts. No refunds on Magic points, even if you see no ghosts or none of them can help you.  Ordinary supporting characters sometimes develop this sense spontaneously, without knowing the first thing about sorcery. They may be victims of curses or physical trauma. Some received tissue transplants from dead donors who have become restless ghosts. They react to their new sense with understandable terror, and can’t choose when they see ghosts."

          name: prediction
          description: "Spend 1 Magic to gain good, if somewhat obscure, advice or information about the future.  Most traditional Chinese mages employ the I Ching (pronounced yee jing), the ancient Book of Changes. You perform the divination by using an apparently random method to select one of its 64 cryptic verses, or hexagrams. The traditional method of invoking randomness has the user dividing yarrow stalks into odd and even clusters, arriving at a pair of trigrams. Trigrams are parallel broken or unbroken lines arranged in threes. Add the two trigrams together and you’ve got your hexagram. Example hexagrams include “Coupling,” “Diminishing,” or “The Well.” The real art comes in connecting the enigmatic verse and its other symbolic associations to the question you’re posing.  Even more traditional mages tell fortunes by throwing tortoise shells into the fire and then interpreting the patterns of cracks that appear on them after they are burned.  The GM provides a cryptic answer to a question posed by the sorcerer. This answer makes the player work to puzzle out its meaning and moves the plot along by providing a clue that gets the characters to the next scene.  If the GM is familiar with I Ching she can choose in advance an applicable hexagram.  If the attempt fails, the sorcerer gets a random hexagram instead. (The I Ching being what it is, the players may well find just as good advice in the random hexagram!)"

If spent in the second half of a game session, your Magic does not reset at the beginning of the next session.  Most often used as an inducement to get powerful, elderly people — sometimes kept alive only by such magics — to aid you.  Chinese mythology inextricably associates sorcery with the pursuit of immortality. Boss sorcerers’ evil schemes may revolve around cracking its secrets. It’s not much use to action movie heroes, though. Accordingly, you get this schtick for free the first time you acquire another Heal schtick as an advancement.
