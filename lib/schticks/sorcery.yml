        area the adverse condition Snow until the next keyframe. When the condition expires, roll a single die. On an even result, it renews until the next keyframe.
Conjured Blade
q You create a handheld blade of magical force and wade into hand-to-hand combat. As per Chi Blast, but doesn’t count as a ranged attack, and so is useful against an opponent whose schticks somehow thwart ranged attacks.
Disintegration
q As per Chi Blast. Also: on a successful attack, spend 2 Magic to utterly destroy a weapon of your choice carried by the target. You can’t choose a signature weapon.
Escher Blast
q As per Chi Blast. Also: on a successful attack, spend 1 Magic to give the combat area the adverse condition Confined Space until the next keyframe.
Fire Blast
q As per Chi Blast. When you take out a mook, spend 1 Magic and roll a single die. On an even die result, you take out another mook and roll a single die. If that result is even, you take out yet another mook, and so on, until you roll an odd result or run out of mooks to take out.
q This is also useful for setting fires, lighting cigars and cigarettes in an impressive manner, heating up coffee, increasing room temperature, and thawing out frozen foods.
Flesh Melter
q As per Chi Blast. Also: on a successful attack, spend x Magic to give target 1 Impairment from the horrific sight of her flesh melting off. X varies by foe type: 1 for featured foes, 2 for bosses. Targets never suffer more than 2 Impairment from this or any other source.
Foggy Tendril
q As per Chi Blast. Also: on a successful attack, spend 1 Magic to give the combat area the adverse condition Obscured Vision until the next keyframe.
              
 Flying Weapon
q You create from thin air a glowing, magical weapon or weapons — for example, a sword, spear, or rain of knives — which hurls towards your opponent. As per Chi Blast. Also: on a successful attack, target spends 1 shot.
Ice Blast
q As per Chi Blast. Also, on a successful attack, spend 1 Magic, your target must spend 3 shots freeing himself from an encasing layer of ice. Targets with Strength Checks above 7 spend only 1 shot.
q Also useful for making ice cubes, freezing or chilling food, making water solid enough to walk on, and cooling the temperature in a hot room.
Lightning Blast
q As per Chi Blast. Also, on a successful attack, spend 1 Magic to require your target to spend 3 shots recovering from a stunning effect. Targets with Constitution Checks above 7 spend only 1 shot.
q Spend 1 Magic to recharge or power any electrical device. Device works for one scene.
Lucky 8 Blast
q As per Chi Blast. On an Outcome of 4 or more, regain 1 spent Magic.
Magnetic Blast
q When you hit a vehicle with a Chi Blast, it takes +3 Condition Points.
pathogen
q As per Chi Blast. Also: on a successful attack, spend 1 Magic. For the remainder of the adventure, Wound Points dealt by the attack can only be removed by the Sorcery Heal schtick.
Divination
Seers and prognosticators have been peering into the future since time immemorial. Join their ranks, and use magic to gather information.
In a Backlash, you suffer bad luck. On your next two important checks (as chosen by the GM), roll an additional negative die on your Swerves.
                 Allegiance

q
 q Spend 1 shot or 1 Magic to tell if a person you can see (in person) knowingly works for a faction or conspiracy. If you have heard of the faction or conspiracy, you know which one. Otherwise, you only see that the person is a player in the Chi War. Shot cost matters only if you’re seeking this story benefit in mid-fight.
Assessment
q Spend 1 shot or 1 Magic to tell if any of the enemies you face are bosses, and if so, which ones.
Bullseye
q Spend 1 shot or 1 Magic to identify the named foe you have the best chance of hitting with a Chi Blast.
Elevated Senses
q Spend 1 Magic to gain (your choice) +3 to Notice, or a Notice value of 12, until end of scene.
Exposure
q Spend 2 shots or 1 Magic to tell whether a person you can see is a Transformed Animal.
Fight Finder
q Spend 1 Magic to know the location of the nearest group of people who want to kill you. You do not know which group. If no one wants to kill you, it must be early in the series. You get the spent Magic back.
Ghost Sense
Ghosts capable of acting on the physical world, like the ones represented by the Ghost archetype, are rare. Ordinary ghosts, trapped in spirit form between this world and the next, mindlessly repeating moments from their living days, swarm through every place where people have lived and died.
q Spend 1 Magic to see the ghosts all around you in a single scene. Unless you count the odd grotesque transformation or ineffective lunge in your direction, they can’t really communicate with you. But their presence and appearance may provide clues to past events in the area. Densely populated areas

 always crawl with ghosts. No refunds on Magic points, even if you see no ghosts or none of them can help you.
Ordinary supporting characters sometimes develop this sense spontaneously, without knowing the first thing about sorcery. They may be victims of curses or physical trauma. Some received tissue transplants from dead donors who have become restless ghosts. They react to their new sense with understandable terror, and can’t choose when they see ghosts.
prediction
q Spend 1 Magic to gain good, if somewhat obscure, advice or information about the future.
Most traditional Chinese mages employ the I Ching (pronounced yee jing), the ancient Book of Changes. You perform the divination by using an apparently random method to select one of its 64 cryptic verses, or hexagrams. The traditional method of invoking randomness has the user dividing yarrow stalks into odd and even clusters, arriving at a pair of trigrams. Trigrams are parallel broken or unbroken lines arranged in threes. Add the two trigrams together and you’ve got your hexagram. Example hexagrams include “Coupling,” “Diminishing,” or “The Well.” The real art comes in connecting the enigmatic verse and its other symbolic associations to the question you’re posing.
Even more traditional mages tell fortunes by throwing tortoise shells into the fire and then interpreting the patterns of cracks that appear on them after they are burned.
The GM provides a cryptic answer to a question posed by the sorcerer. This answer makes the player work to puzzle out its meaning and moves the plot along by providing a clue that gets the characters to the next scene.
If the GM is familiar with I Ching she can choose in advance an applicable hexagram.
If the attempt fails, the sorcerer gets a random hexagram instead. (The I Ching being what it is, the players may well find just as good advice in the random hexagram!)
revelation
q Spend 2 shots or 1 Magic to tell if something you are directly looking at is real, or an illusion.
Truthseek
q Spend 1 Magic to tell if someone talking to you in person is speaking the truth as
       he knows it. Spend 1 more Magic to know the real truth, at least as far as the speaker understands it.
Warning
q Spend 1 Magic as you draw a chalk outline on a suitable surface, covering an area of up to 450 square meters (about the size of a convenience store). For the rest of the adventure, you immediately know if anyone crosses the line.
q You can direct a Chi Blast (if you have that schtick) at any one target crossing the line, no matter how far away you are from it in space or time.
Fertility
You measure and modify the flow of chi in the natural environment around you, either for good or ill effect.
A Backlash costs you an extra 1 Magic at the end of any scene in which you spent Magic, until end of session. If at the end of a scene you are unable to pay, you instead take 5 Wound Points per unpaid Magic point.
As a broad story effect, Fertility also allows you to make people, and farmland more fertile, and to boost the health of crops and livestock. You can use this effect, which automatically succeeds whenever you use it, to curry favor with peasants — especially in the Past and Ancient Junctures.
Bend Fate
q As an interrupt when an enemy makes an Attack or Task Check, spend 3 shots and 1 Magic to add extra negative die to the result.
Big Luck
q Spend 1 Magic to gain +3 to Fortune Checks until the end of the next scene in which you make a Fortune Check. (Or end of session, if that comes sooner.)
De-Attunement
q Spend 2 shots and make a Sorcery Check against the Will Resistance of any foe attuned to one or more feng shui sites. (Featured foes may or may not be; boss foes almost invariably are. Mooks never are.) If successful, target takes 1 Impairment until end of fight.
           
Doom Boon
qRegain all spent Magic points after succeeding at an Up Check.
Harvest Chi
q After a successful attack against a named foe, you may subtract 3 from its Outcome to regain a spent Magic point.
observe Chi
q See the flow of chi in an area, noting how strong or weak it is and if it is corrupted or impinged upon by some unnatural force. Immediately identify feng shui sites. Tell whether an individual you can see in person is attuned to at least one feng shui site.
quid to quo
q When you receive a boost from an ally, roll a die. On an even result, the ally also gains the benefit of the boost.
radiant Grant
q When you give an ally a boost, roll a die. On an even result, choose a second ally to also gain the benefit of your boost.
           Superior Evasion

q
q On a failed attack against an enemy with a higher Defense than yours, spend 1 shot. Until the next keyframe, your Defense equals the enemy’s Defense +1.
Yin to Yang
q Spend 1 Magic as an interrupt when you take Wound Points. Your next successful attack deals no fewer than this number of Wound Points.
Widen the Circle
q Spend 1 shot as an interrupt when an ally grants a boost to any other ally. You also gain the benefit of that boost.
Heal
This ability lets you restore individuals to good health and repair objects. If you learned your magic the Chinese way, you are in all probability an alchemist. You whip up cures by mixing various powders and potions you carry on your person. These are then either applied externally or taken orally. Laying on of hands to heal is a special effect more appropriate for Western characters.
On a Backlash, you take 10 Wound Points.

q Spend 1 Magic to eliminate any one effect of a foe schtick that continues past the end of a fight.
Cure Disease
q Spend 3 Magic to cure any terminal illness, 2 to cure any serious non-fatal illness, 1 to cure any minor debilitating ailment.
Heal object
q Make a Sorcery Check to restore a damaged inanimate object to its original condition, using Difficulties suggested by the table below. GMs set Difficulties for unlisted items, with larger objects being harder than small ones, and complicated devices harder than simple ones. You get one try to heal any particular given object, ever.
Due to the well-known mystical principle of, I dunno, uh, transitive numinosity, vehicle healing is its own separate schtick, below. You can’t heal vehicles with Heal Object.

4 shots.
Iron Mind powder
q Spend 1 Magic to cancel a foe schtick effect that does something to an ally and is otherwise due to expire at the end of the sequence, keyframe, or fight.
Shared Bounty
q Spend 1 shot to remove 10 of your own Wound Points. The enemy with the highest Wound Points total also removes 10 Wound Points. You can only use this if at least one enemy has 10 Wound Points.
vitamin S
q Spend 1 Magic to grant yourself or an ally either +3 to Constitution Checks or a Toughness value of 12 for the purposes of making Constitution Checks (your choice) until end of scene.
Influence
This schtick allows the spellcaster to affect the emotions, thoughts, and sensory input of humans and other intelligent beings.
              Bonus Schtick: Immortality
The quest for immortality occupies a central position in Chinese magical lore.
q Spend 5 Magic to reverse a year’s worth of aging in any target. If spent in the second half of a game session, your Magic does not reset at the beginning of the next session.
Most often used as an inducement to get powerful, elderly people — sometimes kept alive only by such magics — to aid you.
Bonus: Chinese mythology inextricably associates sorcery with the pursuit of immortality. Boss sorcerers’ evil schemes may revolve around cracking its secrets. It’s not much use to action movie heroes, though. Accordingly, you get this schtick for free the first time you acquire another Heal schtick as an advancement.
   
 On a Backlash, you become susceptible to the malign influence of random mischief spirits. The next time you make a failed attack, you then, as a 0-shot interrupt, launch another attack against another hero, targeting the one with the highest Wound Point total. In the event of a tied high Wound Point total (for example if no one has any Wound Points), you attack the hero who last made an attack.
Brain Fortress
q Spend 1 Magic to grant yourself or an ally either +3 to Will Checks or a Will value of 12 (your choice) until end of scene.
Exemplary prostrations
q Spend 1 Magic to seem trustworthy to all authority figures present in the current scene. Lasts until end of adventure, or until you actively violate their trust, whichever comes first.
False Memory
q Spend 1 Magic and make a Sorcery Check against the Will Resistance of a GMC you are engaged in conversation with, and regards you in a positive or neutral light. In about a hundred words or less, describe an experience the target is supposed to have had, but did not. On a success, the subject believes that this happened to her. +3 to the subject’s Will Resistance if the incident strains credulity, but not the subject’s self- image or sense of reality. +8 if the incident does contravene the subject’s self-image or sense of reality.
Greed potion
q Spend 1 Magic to formulate a potion which, if ingested by a featured foe or supporting character, causes him to obsessively seek a particular item of value. At the end of each subsequent scene, make a Sorcery Check against the target’s Will Resistance. The effect ends when you fail a check, or at end of session, whichever comes sooner.
Hate potion
q Spend 1 Magic to formulate a potion which, if ingested by a featured foe or supporting character, causes him to curse and despise another character specified by the sorcerer at time of formulation. At the end of each subsequent scene, make a Sorcery Check against the target’s Will Resistance. The
            effect ends when you fail a check, or at end of session, whichever comes sooner.
Illusion
8
q
 q Spend 1 Magic to make one object or person look, smell, and sound like something else of roughly the same size and physical configuration until end of scene. Or create an illusion from thin air, registering to sight, smell, and hearing, but not to touch or taste. Characters encountering the illusion make Notice Checks to identify it as false; if successful, they know something weird or magical is going on. Sorcerers with at least 1 Divination schtick get a +5 bonus to their Notice Checks.
Illusions affect characters’ responses during story scenes but not in combat. During a fight they may not consciously twig to the false vision, but happen to make decisions allowing them to conduct themselves effectively.
Love potion
q Spend 1 Magic to formulate a potion which, if ingested by a featured foe or supporting character, causes him to fall head over heels in love with another character specified by the sorcerer at time of formulation. If attraction to the object of affection contradicts the ingesting character’s orientation, the pull remains powerful but platonic. At the end of each subsequent scene, make a Sorcery Check against the target’s Will Resistance. The effect ends when you fail a check, or at end of session, whichever comes sooner.
Mind Control
q When a featured foe declares an attack, spend 4 shots as an interrupt to choose a new hero, named character, or mook as target for the attack.
override Will
q Spend 1 Magic and make a Sorcery Check against the Will Resistance of a GMC you can see in person, and is in a relaxed state of mind. On a success, the target executes, to the best of his ability, a single instruction of 25 words or less. +3 to the target’s Will Resistance for an instruction that clearly threatens his interests or self-image. +8 for an instruction that violates his safety or that of others.

 Spatial Confusion
Make yourself appear to be where you aren’t, and not where you are.
q Spend 1 Magic and 1 shot to check Sorcery against a target’s Will Resistance value. On a success, gain +1 Sorcery and +1 Defense against that target until the next keyframe.
Movement
Allows the spellcaster to move objects around from a distance.
The Backlash from any movement effect causes the sorcerer to be violently hurled a number of meters equal to the Difficulty of the check in a random direction, taking a Smackdown equal to the number of meters.
Altruistic Switcheroo
q As an interrupt when you or an ally is hit by an attack, spend 2 shots to choose either yourself or another willing ally to take the hit instead. Use the new recipient’s Toughness to determine how many Wound Points get dished out.
Far Lift
q Cause an inanimate object to rise into the air, move horizontally, and then none-too- q gently set itself down again. Maximum vertical distance and maximum horizontal distance both equal your current Magic points in meters. Difficulty is 1 for every 5
kg the object weighs.
This takes 3 shots, if used in combat. If you’re dropping the object on an enemy, the Damage Value of the dropped object equals the Difficulty of your Sorcery Check. Your check must also exceed the target’s Defense.
Flight
qq
Harsh Switcheroo
q As an interrupt when an enemy is hit by an attack, spend 1 shot and make a Sorcery Check against the Defense of another enemy. On a success, the second enemy takes the hit instead. Use the new recipient’s Toughness to determine how many Wound Points get dished out.
           Fly through the air, moving up to 5 m per shot.
   Muscular Infusion
q Spend 1 Magic to grant yourself or an ally either +3 to Strength Checks or a Strength value of 12 (your choice) until end of scene.
remote Manipulation
q Perform manual tasks involving distant objects or devices. Difficulty of the Sorcery Check equals your distance in meters from the object, which you must be able to see.
Slowdown
q Spend X Magic and 3 shots to make a Sorcery Check against an enemy’s Defense; if successful, enemy’s Speed decreases by X until end of fight. Speed can’t be reduced below 1.
Summoning
This specialty grants you power over beings with Creature Powers, referred to here as creatures.
On a Backlash, you accidentally summon 3 demons from the Underworld (use mook stats, p. 192, with Damage 10 (claw/bite)) per hero present in the scene. They immediately attack the group.
Banishment
q Spend 3 Magic and 3 shots; on a Sorcery success against a supernatural creature’s Defense, it Cheeses It. On a failure, you regain the Magic points.
Corruption
q Spend 1 Magic and 3 shots to grant +1 to the Attacks, Defense, and checks of all creatures engaged in the fight, until the next keyframe.
Demon Spoor Extract
q Spend 1 Magic to cancel a foe schtick effect that directly bolsters a foe and is otherwise due to expire at the end of the sequence, keyframe, or fight.
Echoes of the past
q If you deal Wound Points to a Transformed Animal foe, and it goes down at any later point in the fight, it reverts to its animal form. Transformed Animal heroes present for this take 3 Reversion points.
                
 Exorcism
qq
Invocation
qSpend 2 Magic to seize a particular creature through time and space and cause it to appear at your side. You can target a creature if you successfully used Domination against it in the past, or if you have on your person a former body part of the creature, such as a claw, piece of hair, scraping of skin, or severed hand. Requires a Sorcery Check against the creature’s Will Resistance value; on a failure, nothing happens and you get the Magic points back. Merely summoning a creature does not ensure its cooperation. In fact, in most cases guarantees your subject’s extreme displeasure.
You can invoke hero ghosts or supernatural creatures, but only if their players want it to happen. If they do, your attempt automatically succeeds and costs you nothing.
 Spend 1 Magic or 3 shots to free a single individual of any effects caused by Sorcery or Creature Powers.
     purification
q Spend 1 Magic and 3 shots to levy a –1 penalty to the Attacks, Defense, and checks of all creatures engaged in the fight, until the next keyframe.
Sustained Domination
q Spend 1 Magic and make a Sorcery Check with a creature’s Will Resistance value as the Difficulty. The creature will obey your spoken instructions for a number of hours equal to your Outcome, or until end of session, whichever comes sooner. It will not fight for you but will otherwise obey the letter of your instructions to the best of its abilities. Does not work on bosses or uber-bosses.
quick Domination
q Spend 1 Magic and X shots; make a Sorcery Check with a creature’s Will Resistance value as the Difficulty. The creature fights as your ally for X shots, attacking targets you designate. Does not work on bosses or uber-bosses.
