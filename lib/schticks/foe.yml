Suitable for: Supernatural Creature.

After the fight, the victim falls into a sickened, semi-conscious state. It can be ended, and the contagion cured, with an expenditure of 3 Magic points by a character with any schtick from the Sorcery Heal specialty. This expenditure cures any number of victims. Absent this intervention, the group becomes aware of a cure that requires them to take action in the storyline. They incur a debt or negative consequence to get or administer the cure.
