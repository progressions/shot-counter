          description: "Suitable for: Supernatural Creature.  After the foe does 1 or more Wound Points on a successful Bite attack, the victim makes a Defense Check against the foe’s attack result. On a failure, the victim begins to turn into a version of the foe, and takes 1 Impairment until end of fight.  Only one hero per fight suffers the Contagion effect.  After the fight, the victim falls into a sickened, semi-conscious state. It can be ended, and the contagion cured, with an expenditure of 3 Magic points by a character with any schtick from the Sorcery Heal specialty. This expenditure cures any number of victims. Absent this intervention, the group becomes aware of a cure that requires them to take action in the storyline. They incur a debt or negative consequence to get or administer the cure.  The cure for the key jiangshi’s contagion effect draws on common folklore and is found in that foe’s description on p. 194."
