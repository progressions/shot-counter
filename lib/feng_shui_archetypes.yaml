    description: "You exert supreme mastery over mankind's perfect missile weapon, the bow and arrow. With perfect serenity you pull the drawstring. With a sense of time's crystalline nature, you divide the moment of aiming into a spiderweb of interlocking infinities. At the moment of precision, you loose the string. Your mind's eye flies through the air, following the arrowhead as it closes the distance between you and your target. With the silence of the serpent, it strikes. Already you have drawn another arrow, ready to repeat. Guns may be louder, faster, more destructive. But no one deals death more beautifully than you."

Imperial taxes drove you into poverty. Perhaps you were the victim of other bandits. In any case, you turned your back on society. You began to live off what you could steal. With guile and determination, you turned survival into not only a way of life, but a source of inspiration for others. What life dished out to you, you took, and converted into power. Other bandits now flock to you. Imperial soldiers hunt you. Merchants shudder whenever someone speaks your name. And yet, you find yourself returning to the very society that you once abandoned. Something draws you there—something you wish to fight for—something you must defend. You have taken the first few steps on a new road. It leads either to redemption, or to death."

You might be on vacation when the action begins. You find yourself in a crossfire as the result of a job-related errand.

That's because of your basic, essential decency and/or stupidity. And also your peculiar luck. On one hand, your luck gets you through situations that even you don't believe you could survive, but on the other hand, your luck tends to get you into weird and frightening situations to begin with because the good guys need your help. You may not be the smartest, or the strongest, or the most skilled person in the world. But you're a good guy, and \"Good guys always fnish—ugh! Hey, wha'd you shoot me for? Oh, man, now I'm bleeding... howzabout a knuckle sandwich?\" A good choice if you like to play mechanically simple characters."

    description: "Afghanistan. Iraq. Places you still aren't allowed to name. A former member of an elite force trained in counter-terrorism, hostage rescue, and sabotage missions, you had a hard-bitten military mindset drilled into you along with your extensive list of deadly skills. It is possible that you were dishonorably discharged from your beloved corps, fairly or otherwise, this might be your melodramatic hook. People keep expecting you to relax, to kick back, to get along, just like everybody else. But you can't. Your nerves are still on edge. Whenever you get into a fender bender, or a confrontation on the street, it takes all of your determination not to leap on the guy harassing you and beat him to a pulp. You long for a new cause to believe in, one you can feel as much fervor for as your old corps. Most of all, you want the pure rush you get from combat. There's nothing you'd like more than to feel the taste of blood and fear in your mouth on another battlefield. If that battlefield involves a fight for justice and freedom against tyrants from across the timestream, so much the better."

You might think of yourself as a holy warrior, implacably gunning down anything that smacks of the occult. Or maybe you wish you could build a bridge between the world of the supernatural and the world of everyday humanity. Magic cops are often drawn into the chi war as they hunt down agents of the Lotus or escapees from the Netherworld, discovering that there is much hidden beneath reality's mundane veneer that even they know nothing about."

Embarking on a lifetime's study, you have lately mastered a number of esoteric chi powers. Most importantly, you have absorbed a profound truth: martial arts are more than just a series of combat moves. They represent an ancient and learned discipline, one that preaches restraint, discipline, and humility. You work hard to live up to that philosophy. You choose your fights carefully, and work to uphold the values you have learned, such as reverence for elders, respect for the traditions of the past, and self-sacrifice for the greater good. You probably work at a humble job, caring little for material goods. The only goal you consider worthy of pursuing is the physical and spiritual perfection attained by the great masters of the past. When you encounter the outlines of the chi war, your dedication to honor and self-perfection leads you into the battle against evil without a second thought."

Although your abilities are formidable, you do not expect to transform society all on your own. Only when people stand up for themselves and take back their own streets will the criminals of the world truly quake in fear. Rhetoric aside, your mission may not be entirely altruistic: the Masked Avenger's melodramatic hook usually involves sworn vengeance of some sort. Did some terrible event that pushed you over the edge from thinking about vigilantism to stalking the streets in funny clothes looking for villains to punish?

But in Feng Shui, the term 'Ninja' is also used generically to describe any operative who specializes in stealth and penetration missions. Although capable of holding your own during a fight, you prefer deception and surprise over the frontal assault. Ninjas maintain a mystique around themselves, often pretending to have secret mystical powers. Although the Ninja does have a passing acquaintance with esoteric chi abilities, the mystery surrounding you is mostly due to your own wit and presence. It is not fame that you crave so much as cultivating that mystique. You wish your deeds to be famous, but your identity a secret. You want to be feared. You want to be whispered about. Nothing amuses you more than to stand among people who have no clue just how quick and deadly you are. But lately, you have begun to feel a sense of emptiness. Maybe you have suffered a loss in love, or some other personal blow that has made you feel less invincible than usual. Perhaps you've begun to question your amoral existence. When you discover the chi war, you are pulled in either by your melodramatic hook, or by the awakening of a desire to do something—to leave a mark on the world, even if no one will ever know your name."

    description: "Sometimes the greatest warrior fights by healing his comrades. With your mastery of pressure points, perhaps in tandem with Western medicine, you keep your fellow heroes up, when they would otherwise fall. Whether they're bruised, battered, scorched or riddled with bullets, you can supply the few miraculous jabs required to send them tottering back into the fight for another round of brutal punishment. You serve as headmaster of a martial arts school, healer to the surrounding neighborhood, and beacon of wisdom for all who seek your counsel. You teach your students to embrace the honor and tranquillity of Chinese philosophy. A man of peace, you were dragged only reluctantly into a battle with the injustices of your age, and from there into the fires of the chi war. You would sooner bring your adversaries to light than kick them into the darkness. But because you are a humble, learned person, you are not so arrogant as to think that you can heal everyone. When push comes to shove, sometimes the weak must be defended. On those sad days, you stop setting bones and start breaking them. Want to specialize in healing and denial attacks? Play the Sifu. If you'd rather be the best at fu powers, though you falter in the stretch, play the Old Master."

    description: "You are a master of the occult arts, studied in the ancient techniques of channeling and transforming chi energy into a supernatural force, bent by your will. Some say this corrupts chi energy into what it was not meant to be. You call those people fools. Although there are many ways to do harm to an opponent, none has quite the awe-inspiring effect of an energy bolt cast from a magician's hand. You have some trouble manifesting your great powers in later junctures, such as our own and 1850, where the chi flow has been suppressed. But in other junctures, you access your unearthly abilities without impediment. However, in most places superstitious cretins assume that all sorcerers pursue sinister ends. True, most of you who follow the ways of the occult wind up doing great harm to the people. They have been corrupted by exposure to the Underworld, the home of demons and evil spirits. Or perhaps they have been seduced by their own lust for power. But that does not describe you! You have the will to resist, where weaker minds have failed. Given the bad reputation of sorcerers, you have learned to keep your mystic abilities hidden as you fight for the right side of the chi war. With the sorcerer's versatility comes some additional complexity. You will want to own a copy of the book to play it to the fullest."

You are yourself a being that human would describe as a monster or evil spirit, but you are not evil, for even the denizens of the Underworld are capable of exercising free will and doing right instead of wrong. You realize, however, that almost none of your kindred bother to make this effort. They live to terrorize and to inflict pain. You did, too, until you were summoned and dominated by the cruel eunuch sorcerers of the Eaters of the Lotus. At first, you followed their orders—you had no choice. Shackled by mystic bonds. But eventually you were able, through intense mental effort, to break free of their influence. You saw around you people who lived in fear, people whose lives were seen as mere playthings by your Lotus masters. And although most demons would never even think such thoughts, you decided that you would atone for the wrongs you had done, and destroy those who had forced you to do them. Supernatural Creatures vary widely in appearance, but all are horrific. Some appear as decomposed human corpses, others as grotesque ogres. Others show no resemblance to the humanoid form. Although you may now fight for the forces of good, your alarming features prevent you from ever passing as a normal member of society."

You also plan for something to go wrong. That's when the adrenaline kicks in, when you have to think fast and get it right the first time. When the alarms are screaming and the footfalls of heavily-armed guards are rushing your way, when the distance to your getaway vehicle seems impossibly vast in the moment you have left to you—that's the moment you live for. That's not mere money is just gravy. Still, there's a thought nagging at the back of your skull that maybe all of this thrill-seeking is just a little bit meaningless—maybe even adolescent. Lately you've been thinking about leaving a positive mark on the world. Robbing from the rich and giving to the poor, or something like that. Is there a way to use your skills for the greater good?"
